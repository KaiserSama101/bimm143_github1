# Clustering

we will start today's lab with clustering methods, in particular so-called K-means. The main function for this in R is `kmeans()`

Let's try it on some made up data where we know that what the answer should be.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10000, mean=3)
hist(x)
```

60 points

```{r}
tmp <- c(rnorm(30, mean=3), rnorm(30,mean=-3))
x <- cbind(x=tmp, y=rev(tmp))
x
```

We can pass this to the base R `plot()` function for a quick

```{r}
plot(x)
```

```{r}
k <- kmeans(x, centers=2, nstart=20)
k
```

>Q1. How many points are in each cluster

```{r}
k$size
```
>Q2. Cluster membership?

```{r}
k$cluster
```

>Q3. Cluster centers?

```{r}
k$centers
```
