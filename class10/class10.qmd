First let's see what is in the PDN database-the mainrepository of protein structures.

Downloaded composition stats from: https://www.rcsb.org/stats/summary

For context: Release 2023_04 of 13-Sep-2023 of UniProtKB/TrEMBL contains 251600768 sequence entries.

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("PDBstats.csv", row.names = 1)
stats
```
There is a problem here due to the commas in the numbers. this cause R to treat them as characters.
```{r}
x<- stats$X.ray
x
```
```{r}
as.numeric( gsub(",", "", x) )
```
```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x) {
  as.numeric( gsub(",", "", x) )
}
```
```{r}
rm.comma(stats$X.ray)
```
I can use 'apply()' to fix the whole table…
```{r}
pdbstats <- apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
rownames(pdbstats) <-rownames(stats)
head(pdbstats)
```
```{r}
totals <-apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)
totals
```
Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.
```{r}
round(totals/totals["Total"] *100,2)
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
round(totals/totals["Total"] *100,2)
```
>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(pdbstats[1, "Total"]/ sum(pdbstats [, "Total"]) * 100, 2)
```

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPED for time

Protein structures in PDB as a fraction of Uniprot sequences. See:https://www.uniprot.org/help/release-statistics

```{r}
round( (pdbstats[1, "Total"]/ 251600768)*100,2)
```

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

This is a 2 Angstrom structure and hydrogen is not visible at this resolution. In X-ray crystal structure, hydrogen atoms are generally not detected because they have only one electron. This means they contribute very little to the electron density maps that are used to determine atom positions.But the oxygen atom have 8 electrons so it is more visible, hence for the water molecules we can just see one atom which is the oxygen in the molecule in this sturcture. 

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

Water HDH 308

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.


```{r}
getwd()
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100"}
knitr::include_graphics("1HSG.png",error = FALSE)
```


Here are 2 lovely figures of HIP-Pr with the catalytic ASP residues,the MK1 compound and the all important water 308(1 is the simple one, one is with surroundings).


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100"}
knitr::include_graphics("1HSGASP25.png",error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("1HSGS.png",error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```
```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```


>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

198

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2

>Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 

msa

>Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: 

bio3d-view

>Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? 

TRUE


>
Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 

214
